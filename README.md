- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Himanshu (@himanshuvnm).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in operator theoretic data-driven science and artificial intelligence powered by certain classes of mathematical functions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of exciting things, obviously in the field of scientific data! Presently, I am focusing on Graph Foundation Models and its related perpsective on a certain data sets called as DFNWorks. I am also developing novel theories for the data driven science in the scope of Koopman operator via its spectral analysis. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : just email me at singh_h@lanl.gov. This is my official email address.
