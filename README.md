# Himanshu Singh, PhD  
Applied Mathematics · Machine Learning · Scientific AI · Interpretability

I am an applied mathematics and machine learning researcher with a strong focus on mathematically grounded AI, scientific machine learning, operator learning, and mechanistic interpretability. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I develop scalable learning systems for scientific and large-scale data.

My research interests span:
- Scientific Machine Learning & Operator Learning  
- Reproducing Kernel Methods and Sparse Modeling  
- Probabilistic & Information-Theoretic Learning  
- Foundation Models and Large-Scale AI Systems  
- Mechanistic Interpretability of Neural Networks  

I am particularly interested in building **principled, interpretable, and efficient AI systems** grounded in mathematical structure.

## 🔬 Featured Research Projects

### 1) Generalized Gaussian Radial Basis Function (GGRBF) Networks  
**Mathematical Foundations of Kernel-Based Learning**

📌 Repository:  
https://github.com/himanshuvnm/Generalized-Gaussian-Radial-Basis-Function-in-Artificial-Intelligence-MATLAB  

This project develops a generalized Gaussian radial basis function (GGRBF) framework for nonlinear function approximation and learning in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). It provides a mathematically principled extension of classical RBF networks and studies their approximation and generalization behavior.

**Key themes:**
- Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)  
- Function approximation theory
